## Functionality Details

### Currency Echange Rate Functionality

Use of publicly accessible ECB dataset:

  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml

### Data store 

  We are utilising a Datastore as an ObservableObject to keep track of the transactions.

  Some functionalities have been reduced to a minimum using mock data such as in the TranfsferService.
